## Hi, I'm Aaron Mansfield!

My coding journey began when I was just 13 years old. I got my first PC and enjoyed playing Garry's Mod. When I discovered that custom experiences could be created, I eagerly dove into learning LUA. I had been dreaming of learning to code since I was 9, and discovering LUA gave me the perfect opportunity to do so.

### From LUA to LUAU

Over the course of 6 to 7 months, I became proficient in LUA, and my friend recommended I learn LUAU for ROBLOX. This is where my passion for programming truly took off. I began doing commissioned work, earning impressive income for a 14-year-old kid.

### Exploring Back-End Development

As I continued to grow and learn, I wanted to expand my skillset. I researched further and discovered the world of back-end development, which led me to learn NodeJS. However, I was still eager to learn even more about server-side programming.

### Embracing dotNET & C#

I looked into nearby colleges and found that my current college offers an A-Level course that teaches dotNET & C#. I seized the opportunity and applied, and within a month, I was accepted.

### Diving into Full-Stack and Software Development

My experiences with both front-end and back-end technologies led me to explore full-stack development. With a strong foundation in web and software development, I'm now adept at creating comprehensive, end-to-end solutions for various projects. My passion for coding continues to grow as I constantly learn and innovate in the realm of full-stack and software development. Fast forward a year, and now I'm here on GitHub, sharing everything I learn and create!

### Connect with me

Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me on my linked socials. Let's learn and grow together!
