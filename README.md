## About Me

Hello! I'm Aaron Mansfield. My journey began in 2018 with a fascination for solving real-world problems through code. While I have deep roots in full-stack development—mastering Node.js, Python, and C#—my approach has evolved.

**I am now a Vibe Coder.**

I focus on flow state, rapid iteration, and building at the speed of thought. By leveraging cutting-edge AI architecture, I bridge the gap between complex ideas and deployed software instantly. It's no longer just about writing syntax; it's about orchestration, intent, and pure efficiency.

---

## Current Workflow & Stack

I combine traditional engineering principles with next-gen AI tooling to maximize productivity:

* **⚡ Cursor**: My primary IDE for AI-native development.
* **🤖 Claude Code**: utilized for high-context reasoning and complex logic generation.
* **🚀 Antigravity**: For rapid deployment and friction-free development cycles.
