  <b>I started learning LUA when I was just 13. I got my first PC and enjoyed playing Garry's Mod. When I saw that custom experiences could be made I jumped at the opportunity, did my research and found out about LUA. I'd wanted to code since I was 9, so when I found this out it gave me a perfect reason to learn. Over the course of 6 to 7 months I was getting pretty good at LUA and my friend has recommended I use these LUA skills and learn LUAU for ROBLOX. This is where it all truly began. I was doing commissioned work and getting paid good amounts for a 14 year old kid. But, as anyone would, I wanted to learn more. From here I did some further research and found out about "Back-End" development, this gave me a chance to learn NodeJS. But I still wanted to learn more of the server-side part. I looked into what colleges around me offered and saw that the college I am currently at offers an A-Level course that teaches dotNET & C#. So I took the opportunity and applied, within a month I was accepted. And now, 2 years later, I am here on GitHub posting everything that I am learning and everything that I create!</b>
