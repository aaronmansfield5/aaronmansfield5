# WelcomeðŸ‘‹
**Hello, I'm Aaron! I am an 18 year old college student from England currently studying Computer Science, Business and Economics. I am learning C# in my Computer Science class, however my knowledge of coding goes further than that!**
# About Me ðŸ“–
**I started learning LUA when I was just 13. I got my first PC and enjoyed playing Garry's Mod. When I saw that custom experiences could be made I jumped at the opportunity, did my research and found out about LUA. I'd wanted to code since I was 9, so when I found this out it gave me a perfect reason to learn. Over the course of 6 to 7 months I was getting pretty good at LUA and my friend has recommended I use these LUA skills and learn LUAU for ROBLOX. This is where it all truly began. I was doing commissioned work and getting paid good amounts for a 14 year old kid. But, as anyone would, I wanted to learn more. From here I did some further research and found out about "Back-End" development, this gave me a chance to learn NodeJS. But I still wanted to learn more of the server-side part. I looked into what colleges around me offered and saw that the college I am currently at offers an A-Level course that teaches dotNET & C#. So I took the opportunity and applied, within a month I was accepted. And now, 18 months later, I am here on GitHub posting everything that I am learning and everything that I create!**
# My Goals ðŸ¥…
**I am still not where I wish to be. As previously mentioned, I would like to become a back-end web developer. After college I will be applying to universities to study Computer Science at, then hopefully take that further and do my masters. I hope to either work for myself or work for a great tech firm, innovating new technology and building the next generation of computing.**
