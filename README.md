## Hi, I'm Aaron Mansfield!

My coding journey began when I was just 13 years old. I got my first PC and enjoyed playing Garry's Mod. When I discovered that custom experiences could be created, I eagerly dove into learning LUA. I had been dreaming of learning to code since I was 9, and discovering LUA gave me the perfect opportunity to do so.

### From LUA to LUAU

Over the course of 6 to 7 months, I became proficient in LUA, driven by my passion for creating custom experiences in games like Garry's Mod. One day, my friend recommended I learn LUAU for ROBLOX, as it opened up a new world of opportunities in game development and customization. I eagerly took on the challenge and soon became well-versed in LUAU. This new skill allowed me to explore the exciting realm of ROBLOX, where my passion for programming truly took off. I began doing commissioned work, creating various game modes, mechanics, and assets for clients. The projects I worked on not only helped me hone my skills but also provided me with impressive income for a 14-year-old kid. The experience and confidence I gained from these projects further fueled my drive to learn and grow in the world of programming.

### Exploring Back-End Development

As I continued to grow and learn, I felt a strong desire to expand my skillset and delve deeper into the various facets of programming. My curiosity led me to explore the world of back-end development, which plays a crucial role in building the backbone of web applications and services. Eager to master this domain, I began learning Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to create scalable server-side applications.

As I progressed in my journey, I realized the importance of understanding not only server-side programming but also the complex interplay between front-end and back-end technologies. This realization drove me to expand my knowledge of databases, API integrations, and other aspects of full-stack development. My continuous learning and passion for back-end development have opened up new horizons for me in the world of software development, allowing me to create more sophisticated and robust applications.

### Embracing dotNET & C#

I looked into nearby colleges and found that my current college offers an A-Level course that teaches dotNET, C#, and SQL. Intrigued by the possibility of expanding my knowledge, I seized the opportunity and applied. Within a month, I was accepted into the program. The course not only deepened my understanding of dotNET and C# but also introduced me to SQL, which has been essential for working with databases and data-driven applications. This comprehensive learning experience has greatly enhanced my skill set and opened up new opportunities in the world of software development.

### Diving into Full-Stack and Software Development

My experiences with both front-end and back-end technologies led me to explore full-stack development. With a strong foundation in web and software development, I'm now adept at creating comprehensive, end-to-end solutions for various projects. My passion for coding continues to grow as I constantly learn and innovate in the realm of full-stack and software development. Fast forward a year, and now I'm here on GitHub, sharing everything I learn and create!
